## Psychopass

This app takes a randomly generated word from the Wordnik api then uses that word to search SoundCloud for a random track and Giphy for a random gif.

If a song is found, it is played while the random word is displayed over the gif along with the song's comment stream.

Send it out to delight (or not) your friends and enemies!
